# HwGame2_pinball devlog

For this project, I wanted to go more visual than technical-- I had a random idea for a character and decided to run with it. However, I quickly realized that without any special efefcts or anything, it's kind of hard to make the game look good because it just feels flat. I definitely could've done better, especially with the audio. I'm not sure what external audio program I should be using, but the ones I found from freesound are kind of lackluster. On the bright side, I experimented with a few of the joint components to see what I wanted to work with and it showed me how I can kind of make a game without much coding, which I liked. It's fun to tweak and experiment with an UI that I felt more comfortable with (as opposed to code). Next time, I really need to find an audio editer so I can have something to fit into the game.
